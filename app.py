Git
edited this to reflect to rflect and teach git pull


Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's changes. GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, is a popular platform for hosting Git repositories, enabling collaboration, code reviews, and integration with modern CI/CD pipelines.

In every modern software environment, multiple engineers work on the same codebase. Without version control, changes overwrite each other, and progress becomes chaotic.

=== Version control systems (VCS) solve this by tracking every change made to files over time.

Real-world DevOps Context:
Imagine your team at Learn Academy is building a Jenkins-based automation pipeline. Three engineers — one updates Dockerfiles, another modifies the Jenkinsfile, and another adjusts Terraform scripts. Git ensures everyone’s updates are synchronized and recoverable.
